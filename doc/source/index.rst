About
-----

This project is a modular Django site comprising several applications:

- **oc_lettings_site**: Django project folder containing:

  - ``settings.py``: Application configuration

  - ``urls.py``: Main URL routing

  - ``wsgi.py``: WSGI interface for production servers
  
- **lettings**: Manages rental listings (models, views, templates)
- **profiles**: Manages user profiles (models, views, templates)

The advantage of this approach is to separate concerns, making the codebase more maintainable and scalable.

This allows unique responsibilities for each module, facilitating testing and future enhancements.

The project's goal is to ensure maintainability and scalability of the architecture while adhering to best practices in CI/CD and documentation.
